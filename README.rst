Ghostbuster
===========

Eliminate dangling elastic IPs by performing analysis on your resources
within all your AWS accounts.

Ghostbuster obtains all the DNS records present in all of your AWS
accounts (Route53), and can optionally take in records via CSV input, or
via Cloudflare.

After these records are collected, Ghostbuster iterates through all of
your AWS Elastic IPs and Network Interface Public IPs and collects this
data.

By having a complete picture of the DNS records (from route53, file
input or cloudflare) and having a complete picture of the AWS IPs owned
by your organization, this tool can detect subdomains that are pointing
to dangling elastic IPs (IPs you no longer own).

The problem
-----------

When you are deploying infrastructure to AWS, you may spin up EC2
instances which have an IP associated with them. When you create DNS
records pointing to these IPs, but forget to remove the DNS records
after the EC2 instance has been given a new IP or destroyed, you are
susceptible to subdomain takeover attacks.

There has been a great amount of research done on elastic IP takeovers,
where it is possible for attackers to continually claim elastic IPs
until they obtain an IP associated with a subdomain of the company they
are targeting.

While AWS frequently bans accounts that are attempting to perform this
attack pattern, no long term fix has been released by AWS.

The impact of dangling elastic IP subdomain takeover attacks are more
serious than a typical subdomain takeover where you can only control the
content being served. With dangling elastic IP takeovers, it is possible
for an attacker to do the following:

-  Claim SSL certificates for the subdomain
-  Listen for traffic on all ports (potentially discovering sensitive
   information still being sent to the subdomain)
-  Run server-side scripts with the ability to steal HTTPOnly cookies,
   typically leading to a one-click account takeover attack when cookies
   are scoped to ``*.domain.com``

Project Features
----------------

-  Dynamically iterates through each AWS profile configured in
   ``.aws/config``
-  Pulls A records from AWS Route53
-  Pulls A records from Cloudflare (optional)
-  Pulls A records from CSV input (optional)
-  Iterate through all regions, a single region, or a comma delimitted
   list of regions
-  Obtains all Elastic IPs associated with all of your AWS accounts
-  Obtains all Public IPs associated with all of your AWS accounts
-  Cross checks the DNS records, with IPs owned by your organization to
   detect potential takeovers
-  Slack Webhook support to send notifications of takeovers

**Important:**

In order for this tool to be effective, it must have a complete picture
of your AWS environment. If it does not have a complete picture, it will
lead to false positive findings.

Installing Ghostbuster
----------------------

Installing Ghostbuster is as simple as running:
``pip install ghostbuster``. The CLI tool will then be accessible via
the ``ghostbuster`` command.

This requires a Python 3.x environment.

Using Ghostbuster
-----------------

::

   ❯ ghostbuster scan aws --help                                                                                                                                                                     
   Usage: ghostbuster scan aws [OPTIONS]

     Scan for dangling elastic IPs inside your AWS accounts.

   Options:
     --profile TEXT          Specify a specific AWS profile to run ghostbuster
                             on.

                             about potential takeovers.

     --records PATH          Manually specify DNS records to check against.
                             Ghostbuster will check these IPs after checking
                             retrieved DNS records. See records.csv for an
                             example.

     --cloudflaretoken TEXT  Pull DNS records from Cloudflare, provide a CF API
                             token.

     --allregions            Run on all regions.
     --exclude TEXT          Comma delimited list of profile names to exclude.
     --regions TEXT          Comma delimited list of regions to run on.
     --help                  Show this message and exit.

**Example Commands**

Run Ghostbuster with access to Cloudflare DNS records, send
notifications to a Slack webhook, iterate through every AWS profile
configured in ``.aws/config or .aws/credentials`` for all AWS regions

::

Setting up your AWS accounts
----------------------------

The first step is creating keys or roles in your AWS accounts that grant
the privileges necessary to read Route53 records and describe elastic
addresses and EC2 network interfaces.

1. To create a new IAM user in AWS, visit the following URL:
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new?step=details
2. Choose ``Access key - Programmatic access`` only, and click
   ``Next: Permissions``.
3. Click ``Attach existing policies directly`` and then click
   ``Create policy``.
4. Click ``JSON`` and then paste in the following policy:

.. code:: terraform

   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "GhostbusterPolicy",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ec2:DescribeAddresses",
                   "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
                   "route53:ListResourceRecordSets",
                   "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
                   "route53:GetTrafficPolicyInstance",
                   "route53:GetTrafficPolicy"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }

5.  Click ``Next: Tags`` and then ``Next: Review``.
6.  Set the name of the policy to be ``GhostbusterPolicy``.
7.  Click ``Create Policy``.
8.  Go to
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new?step=permissions&accessKey&userNames=ghostbuster&permissionType=policies
9.  Select ``GhostbusterPolicy``.
10. Click ``Next: Tags`` and then ``Next: Review``.
11. Click on ``Create user`` and setup the AWS credentials in your
    ``.aws/credentials`` file.

Repeat the above steps for each AWS account you own.

This tool will work with however you’ve setup your AWS configuration
(multiple keys, or cross-account assume role profiles). This is managed
by boto3, the library used to interface with AWS.

An example configuration looks like this:

``.aws/credentials``:

::

   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = AKIAIII...
   aws_secret_access_key = faAaAaA...

``.aws/config``:

::

   [default]
   output = table
   region = us-east-1

   [profile account-one]
   role_arn = arn:aws:iam::911111111113:role/Ec2Route53Access
   source_profile = default
   region = us-east-1

   [profile account-two]
   role_arn = arn:aws:iam::911111111112:role/Ec2Route53Access
   source_profile = default
   region = us-east-1

   [profile account-three]
   region = us-east-1
   role_arn = arn:aws:iam::911111111111:role/Ec2Route53Access
   source_profile = default

Alternatively, instead of having roles which are assumed, you can also
configure the ``.aws/credentials`` file to have a list of profiles and
assocaited keys with scoped access.

Once your AWS configuration has been set with all the accounts in your
AWS environment, you can then run the tool using the following command:

Setting up your AWS permissions for –roles
------------------------------------------

Ghostbuster can use roles instead of profiles which removes the need of
having so many credentials at one place. However, roles approach will
require creating additional IAM policies within you organisation.

Roles can be used via ``--roles roles.csv`` or ``--autoroles`` flags. To
setup ``--roles`` to work, one needs to create
GhostbusterTargetAccountRole role **named exactly like that** in every
account that is being scanned:

.. code:: terraform

   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "GhostbusterTargetAccountRole",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ec2:DescribeAddresses",
                   "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
                   "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                   "route53:ListResourceRecordSets",
                   "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
                   "route53:GetTrafficPolicyInstance",
                   "route53:GetTrafficPolicy"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }

The ghostbuster will be running in lambda/ec2/whatever with
``ghostbuster`` role - let’s call it ghostbuster master role. The master
role must be able to assume TargetAccountRoles.

.. code:: terraform

   resource "aws_iam_policy" "ghostbuster_target_account_roles" {
     name        = "ghostbuster_target_account_roles"
     path        = "/"
     description = "Allow inspecting DNS and elastic IP data."

     policy = jsonencode({
       "Version" : "2012-10-17",
       "Statement" : [
         {
           "Effect" : "Allow",
           "Action" : "sts:AssumeRole",
           "Resource" : ["arn:aws:iam::*:role/GhostbusterTargetAccountRole"]
       }]
     })

     tags = {
       Project = "ghostbuster"
     }
   }

Setting up your AWS permissions for –autoroles
----------------------------------------------

Automatic account discovery requires additional permission compared to
–roles. After setting up –roles to work, consider adding following IAM
policy in an account that has organisation overview:

.. code:: terraform

   {
       sid = "BaseAccess"

       actions = [
         "organizations:DescribeAccount",
         "organizations:ListAccounts"
       ]

       resources = ["*"]
       effect    = "Allow"
     }
   }

Then, in the account that is running ghostbuster, attach following
policy to ghostbuster master role so it can assume the organisation
lookup role:

.. code:: terraform

   {
       "Version" : "2012-10-17",
       "Statement" : [
         {
           "Effect" : "Allow",
           "Action" : "sts:AssumeRole",
           "Resource" : ["arn:aws:iam::ORG_LOOKUP_ACCOUNT_ID:role/ghostbuster-org-role"]
       }]
   }

Don’t forget to replace ORG_LOOKUP_ACCOUNT_ID with actual account ID.

Setting up Cloudflare (Optional)
--------------------------------

If you want Ghostbuster to pull in all the A records that you have set
in Cloudflare, you will have to setup an API token that can read zones.

https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens

Setup a Cloudflare API token like shown in the screenshot below:

.. image:: screenshots/cloudflare.png

Once you have obtained this API token, make a note of it somewhere
(password manager). In order to use it with Ghostbuster, pass it in via
the ``cloudflaretoken`` argument.
